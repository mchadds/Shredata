# Shredata

## Description
Shredata (Snow Intelligence) is a project that allows users to compare recent snowfalls of their favourite mountains. Have you ever wondered which hill to go to based on the best new snow? Checking every single resort website for the snow report is time consuming (and inconvenient). Shredata has all this information in one place (with daily updates) so you can find the most snow with ease! This idea was born out of a passion for being outside and utilizing the data at your fingertips.

## Demo
This brief gif demonstrates the power and simplicity of the Shredata application:

## Functionality
- Users can select a snowfall interval (or base) by clicking the blue interval buttons at the top of the application
- This will cause the snowfall information for the selected interval of each resort to appear in the bar chart
- The circle markers on the map (representing each resort) will render with a radius related to the snowfall from the selected interval
- The circle markers include a tooltip containg the resorts name and the snowfall value for the selected interval

## Tools
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) Cloud instance of ski resort database
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) Cloud provider
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) JavaScript runtime environment
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) Framework for API
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) Front end design

## Languages
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) For webscraping snowfall data


## Happy Shredding!
